# Animal Data Scoring Methodology

This dataset contains 202 animals with actual relative scores (0-100) across 8 categories based on real-world data compiled from scientific sources.

## Scoring System (0-100 scale)

### 1. Human Deaths
- **100**: Mosquitoes (~700,000-1,000,000 deaths/year)
- **75**: Humans (~400,000-540,000 deaths/year)
- **65**: Snakes (~50,000-100,000 deaths/year)
- **55**: Dogs (~25,000-30,000 deaths/year via rabies)
- **35**: Crocodiles (~1,000 deaths/year)
- **28**: Elephants (~500 deaths/year)
- **0**: Most animals that don't pose significant threat to humans

### 2. Hair Density
- **100**: Animals with extremely dense fur (pangolins, porcupines, chinchillas)
- **90-95**: Very thick fur (bears, sheep, otters, alpacas)
- **70-85**: Moderate to thick fur (wolves, foxes, cats, deer)
- **40-65**: Light to moderate fur/hair (dogs, horses, cattle, lions)
- **10-35**: Sparse hair (elephants, rhinos, hippos, pigs)
- **0-5**: Hairless or nearly hairless (fish, reptiles, insects)

### 3. Top Speed
- **100**: Peregrine Falcon (200+ mph dive), Cheetah (75 mph land)
- **95-98**: Golden Eagle (150+ mph), Pronghorn (60+ mph)
- **82-92**: Fast runners and fliers (50-70 mph)
- **55-75**: Moderately fast (35-50 mph)
- **25-45**: Slow to moderate speed (15-35 mph)
- **0-20**: Very slow animals (<15 mph)

### 4. Lifespan
Based on maximum/typical lifespan in years:
- **4500**: Coral (exceptional longevity)
- **550**: Ocean Quahog clam
- **225**: Sea urchin
- **125**: Whale shark
- **95**: Humans, Orca
- **85**: Elephants, Greenland sharks
- **65-82**: Long-lived birds and mammals (parrots, condors)
- **35-55**: Medium lifespan (25-60 years)
- **15-30**: Shorter lifespan (10-30 years)
- **1-12**: Very short lifespan (insects, small mammals)

### 5. Population
Based on global population size and conservation status:
- **95-100**: Extremely abundant (humans, dogs, chickens, rats, insects)
- **75-92**: Very common and widespread
- **55-72**: Healthy but moderate populations
- **35-52**: Declining or limited populations
- **15-32**: Vulnerable or endangered
- **0-12**: Critically endangered

### 6. Habitat Extent
Geographic distribution:
- **95-100**: Global distribution (humans, dogs, mosquitoes, rats)
- **75-92**: Very wide distribution across multiple continents
- **55-72**: Regional distribution (1-2 continents)
- **35-52**: Limited regional distribution
- **15-32**: Restricted to specific areas
- **0-12**: Extremely limited range (endemic species)

### 7. Relative Strength
Strength relative to body weight:
- **95**: African Elephant (can lift 9,000 kg)
- **88-92**: Gorilla (10x body weight), Hippo, Orca
- **75-88**: Large predators and strong mammals
- **55-72**: Medium strength relative to size
- **35-52**: Moderate strength
- **15-32**: Lower relative strength
- **0-12**: Very weak relative to body size

Note: Insects like dung beetles (1,100x body weight) would score 100 on absolute relative strength scale.

### 8. Consumption by Humans
Based on global consumption as food:
- **95-98**: Heavily consumed (chicken, pork, beef)
- **75-88**: Very commonly consumed (fish, turkey, lamb, shrimp)
- **55-72**: Moderately consumed (lobster, duck, various fish)
- **25-45**: Less commonly consumed (game meat, some seafood)
- **5-22**: Rarely consumed or in specific regions
- **0-3**: Not consumed or protected species

## Data Sources

Data compiled from:
- IUCN Red List for conservation status and populations
- Scientific literature on animal speeds (Britannica, IFAW, Wikipedia)
- WHO and epidemiological data on human deaths
- Lifespan data from multiple scientific sources
- Consumption data from FAO, OECD, Our World in Data
- Strength measurements from zoological research

## Notes

- Scores are relative within the 0-100 scale for comparative purposes
- Some categories (like lifespan) have extreme outliers that would exceed 100 on a linear scale
- Scores represent general population averages, not maximum or minimum values
- Conservation status is current as of 2024-2025
